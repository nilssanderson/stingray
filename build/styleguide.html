  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <p>CSS is not a pretty language. While it is simple to learn and get started with,
  it soon becomes problematic at any reasonable scale. There isn’t much we can do
  to change how CSS works, but we can make changes to the way we author and
  structure it.</p>

  <p>In working on large, long-running projects, with dozens of developers of
  differing specialities and abilities, it is important that we all work in a
  unified way in order to—among other things—</p>

  <ul>
    <li>keep stylesheets maintainable;</li>
    <li>keep code transparent, sane, and readable;</li>
    <li>keep stylesheets scalable.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There are a variety of techniques we must employ in order to satisfy these
  goals, and <cite>CSS Guidelines</cite> is a document of recommendations and
  approaches that will help us to do so.</p>

  <h3 id="the-importance-of-a-styleguide">The Importance of a Styleguide</h3>

  <p>A coding styleguide (note, not a visual styleguide) is a valuable tool for teams
  who</p>

  <ul>
    <li>build and maintain products for a reasonable length of time;</li>
    <li>have developers of differing abilities and specialisms;</li>
    <li>have a number of different developers working on a product at any given time;</li>
    <li>on-board new staff regularly;</li>
    <li>have a number of codebases that developers dip in and out of.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Whilst styleguides are typically more suited to product teams—large codebases on
  long-lived and evolving projects, with multiple developers contributing over
  prolonged periods of time—all developers should strive for a degree of
  standardisation in their code.</p>

  <p>A good styleguide, when well followed, will</p>

  <ul>
    <li>set the standard for code quality across a codebase;</li>
    <li>promote consistency across codebases;</li>
    <li>give developers a feeling of familiarity across codebases;</li>
    <li>increase productivity.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Styleguides should be learned, understood, and implemented at all times on a
  project which is governed by one, and any deviation must be fully justified.</p>

  <h3 id="disclaimers">Disclaimers</h3>

  <p><cite>CSS Guidelines</cite> is <em>a</em> styleguide; it is not <em>the</em> styleguide. It
  contains methodologies, techniques, and tips that I would firmly recommend to my
  clients and teams, but your own tastes and circumstances may well be different.
  Your mileage may vary.</p>

  <p>These guidelines are opinionated, but they have been repeatedly tried, tested,
  stressed, refined, broken, reworked, and revisited over a number of years on
  projects of all sizes.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2 id="syntax-and-formatting">Syntax and Formatting</h2>

  <p>One of the simplest forms of a styleguide is a set of rules regarding syntax and
  formatting. Having a standard way of writing (<em>literally</em> writing) CSS means
  that code will always look and feel familiar to all members of the team.</p>

  <p>Further, code that looks clean <em>feels</em> clean. It is a much nicer environment to
  work in, and prompts other team members to maintain the standard of cleanliness
  that they found. Ugly code sets a bad precedent.</p>

  <p>At a very high-level, we want</p>

  <ul>
    <li>two (2) space indents, no tabs;</li>
    <li>80 character wide columns;</li>
    <li>multi-line CSS;</li>
    <li>meaningful use of whitespace.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><span class="highlight" id="did-you-see-this-bit">But, as with anything, the
  specifics are somewhat irrelevant—consistency is key.</span></p>

  <h3 id="multiple-files">Multiple Files</h3>

  <p>With the meteoric rise of preprocessors of late, more often is the case that
  developers are splitting CSS across multiple files.</p>

  <p>Even if not using a preprocessor, it is a good idea to split discrete chunks of
  code into their own files, which are concatenated during a build step.</p>

  <p>If, for whatever reason, you are not working across multiple files, the next
  sections might require some bending to fit your setup.</p>

  <h3 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h3>

  <p>A table of contents is a fairly substantial maintenance overhead, but the
  benefits it brings far outweigh any costs. It takes a diligent developer to keep
  a table of contents up to date, but it is well worth sticking with. An
  up-to-date table of contents provides a team with a single, canonical catalogue
  of what is in a CSS project, what it does, and in what order.</p>

  <p>A simple table of contents will—in order, naturally—simply provide the name of
  the section and a brief summary of what it is and does, for example:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>/**
  * CONTENTS
  *
  * SETTINGS
  * Global...............Globally-available variables and config.
  *
  * TOOLS
  * Mixins...............Useful mixins.
  *
  * GENERIC
  * Normalize.css........A level playing field.
  * Box-sizing...........Better default `box-sizing`.
  *
  * BASE
  * Headings.............H1–H6 styles.
  *
  * OBJECTS
  * Wrappers.............Wrapping and constraining elements.
  *
  * COMPONENTS
  * Page-head............The main page header.
  * Page-foot............The main page footer.
  * Buttons..............Button elements.
  *
  * TRUMPS
  * Text.................Text helpers.
  */
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Each item maps to a section and/or include.</p>

  <p>Naturally, this section would be substantially larger on the majority of
  projects, but hopefully we can see how this section—in the master
  stylesheet—provides developers with a project-wide view of what is being used
  where, and why.</p>

  <h3 id="80-characters-wide">80 Characters Wide</h3>

  <p>Where possible, limit CSS files’ width to 80 characters. Reasons for this
  include</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the ability to have multiple files open side by side;</li>
    <li>viewing CSS on sites like GitHub, or in terminal windows;</li>
    <li>providing a comfortable line length for comments.</li>
  </ul>

  <pre><code>/**
  * I am a long-form comment. I describe, in detail, the CSS that follows. I am
  * such a long comment that I easily break the 80 character limit, so I am
  * broken across several lines.
  */</code></pre>

  <p>There will be unavoidable exceptions to this rule—such as URLs, or gradient
  syntax—which shouldn’t be worried about.</p>

  <h3 id="titling">Titling</h3>

  <p>Begin every new major section of a CSS project with a title:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>/*------------------------------------*\
    #SECTION-TITLE
  \*------------------------------------*/

  .selector { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>The title of the section is prefixed with a hash (<code class="highlighter-rouge">#</code>) symbol to allow us to
  perform more targeted searches (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">grep</code>, etc.): instead of searching for
  just <kbd>SECTION-TITLE</kbd>—which may yield many results—a more scoped search
  of <kbd>#SECTION-TITLE</kbd> should return only the section in question.</p>

  <p>Leave a carriage return between this title and the next line of code (be that a
  comment, some Sass, or some CSS).</p>

  <p>If you are working on a project where each section is its own file, this title
  should appear at the top of each one. If you are working on a project with
  multiple sections per file, each title should be preceded by five (5) carriage
  returns. This extra whitespace coupled with a title makes new sections much
  easier to spot when scrolling through large files:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>/*------------------------------------*\
    #A-SECTION
  \*------------------------------------*/

  .selector { }





  /*------------------------------------*\
    #ANOTHER-SECTION
  \*------------------------------------*/

  /**
  * Comment
  */

  .another-selector { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <h3 id="anatomy-of-a-ruleset">Anatomy of a Ruleset</h3>

  <p>Before we discuss how we write out our rulesets, let’s first familiarise
  ourselves with the relevant terminology:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[selector] {
    [property]: [value];
    [&lt;--declaration---&gt;]
  }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>For example:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.foo, .foo--bar,
  .baz {
    display: block;
    background-color: green;
    color: red;
  }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Here you can see we have</p>

  <ul>
    <li>related selectors on the same line; unrelated selectors on new lines;</li>
    <li>a space before our opening brace (<code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span></code>);</li>
    <li>properties and values on the same line;</li>
    <li>a space after our property–value delimiting colon (<code class="highlighter-rouge">:</code>);</li>
    <li>each declaration on its own new line;</li>
    <li>the opening brace (<code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span></code>) on the same line as our last selector;</li>
    <li>our first declaration on a new line after our opening brace (<code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span></code>);</li>
    <li>our closing brace (<code class="highlighter-rouge">}</code>) on its own new line;</li>
    <li>each declaration indented by two (2) spaces;</li>
    <li>a trailing semi-colon (<code class="highlighter-rouge">;</code>) on our last declaration.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This format seems to be the largely universal standard (except for variations in
  number of spaces, with a lot of developers preferring two (2)).</p>

  <p>As such, the following would be incorrect:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.foo, .foo--bar, .baz
  {
    display:block;
    background-color:green;
    color:red }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Problems here include</p>

  <ul>
    <li>tabs instead of spaces;</li>
    <li>unrelated selectors on the same line;</li>
    <li>the opening brace (<code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span></code>) on its own line;</li>
    <li>the closing brace (<code class="highlighter-rouge">}</code>) does not sit on its own line;</li>
    <li>the trailing (and, admittedly, optional) semi-colon (<code class="highlighter-rouge">;</code>) is missing;</li>
    <li>no spaces after colons (<code class="highlighter-rouge">:</code>).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="multi-line-css">Multi-line CSS</h3>

  <p>CSS should be written across multiple lines, except in very specific
  circumstances. There are a number of benefits to this:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A reduced chance of merge conflicts, because each piece of functionality
  exists on its own line.</li>
    <li>More ‘truthful’ and reliable <code class="highlighter-rouge">diff</code>s, because one line only ever carries one
  change.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Exceptions to this rule should be fairly apparent, such as similar rulesets that
  only carry one declaration each, for example:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.icon {
    display: inline-block;
    width:  16px;
    height: 16px;
    background-image: url(/img/sprite.svg);
  }

  .icon--home     { background-position:   0     0  ; }
  .icon--person   { background-position: -16px   0  ; }
  .icon--files    { background-position:   0   -16px; }
  .icon--settings { background-position: -16px -16px; }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>These types of ruleset benefit from being single-lined because</p>

  <ul>
    <li>they still conform to the one-reason-to-change-per-line rule;</li>
    <li>they share enough similarities that they don’t need to be read as thoroughly
  as other rulesets—there is more benefit in being able to scan their selectors,
  which are of more interest to us in these cases.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="indenting">Indenting</h3>

  <p>As well as indenting individual declarations, indent entire related rulesets to
  signal their relation to one another, for example:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.foo { }

    .foo__bar { }

      .foo__baz { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>By doing this, a developer can see at a glance that <code class="highlighter-rouge">.foo__baz {}</code> lives inside
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">.foo__bar {}</code> lives inside <code class="highlighter-rouge">.foo {}</code>.</p>

  <p>This quasi-replication of the DOM tells developers a lot about where classes are
  expected to be used without them having to refer to a snippet of HTML.</p>

  <h4 id="indenting-sass">Indenting Sass</h4>

  <p>Sass provides nesting functionality. That is to say, by writing this:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.foo {
    color: red;

    .bar {
      color: blue;
    }

  }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>…we will be left with this compiled CSS:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.foo { color: red; }
  .foo .bar { color: blue; }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>When indenting Sass, we stick to the same two (2) spaces, and we also leave a
  blank line before and after the nested ruleset.</p>

  <p><strong>N.B.</strong> Nesting in Sass should be avoided wherever possible. See <a href="#specificity">the
  Specificity section</a> for more details.</p>

  <h4 id="alignment">Alignment</h4>

  <p>Attempt to align common and related identical strings in declarations, for
  example:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.foo {
    -webkit-border-radius: 3px;
      -moz-border-radius: 3px;
            border-radius: 3px;
  }

  .bar {
    position: absolute;
    top:    0;
    right:  0;
    bottom: 0;
    left:   0;
    margin-right: -10px;
    margin-left:  -10px;
    padding-right: 10px;
    padding-left:  10px;
  }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>This makes life a little easier for developers whose text editors support column
  editing, allowing them to change several identical and aligned lines in one go.</p>

  <div class="box  box--promo  box--outdent">
      <p>It looks like you’re enjoying these guidelines…</p>
      <p><a href="https://gumroad.com/l/JAgjq" class="btn  btn--full  btn--tertiary">Support Them</a></p>
  </div>

  <h3 id="meaningful-whitespace">Meaningful Whitespace</h3>

  <p>As well as indentation, we can provide a lot of information through liberal and
  judicious use of whitespace between rulesets. We use:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>One (1) empty line between closely related rulesets.</li>
    <li>Two (2) empty lines between loosely related rulesets.</li>
    <li>Five (5) empty lines between entirely new sections.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For example:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>/*------------------------------------*\
    #FOO
  \*------------------------------------*/

  .foo { }

    .foo__bar { }


  .foo--baz { }





  /*------------------------------------*\
    #BAR
  \*------------------------------------*/

  .bar { }

    .bar__baz { }

    .bar__foo { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>There should never be a scenario in which two rulesets do not have an empty line
  between them. This would be incorrect:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.foo { }
    .foo__bar { }
  .foo--baz { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <h3 id="html">HTML</h3>

  <p>Given HTML and CSS’ inherently interconnected nature, it would be remiss of me
  to not cover some syntax and formatting guidelines for markup.</p>

  <p>Always quote attributes, even if they would work without. This reduces the
  chance of accidents, and is a more familiar format to the majority of
  developers. For all this would work (and is valid):</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;div class=box&gt;
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>…this format is preferred:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;div class="box"&gt;
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>The quotes are not required here, but err on the safe side and include them.</p>

  <p>When writing multiple values in a class attribute, separate them with two
  spaces, thus:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;div class="foo  bar"&gt;
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>When multiple classes are related to each other, consider grouping them in
  square brackets (<code class="highlighter-rouge">[</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">]</code>), like so:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;div class="[ box  box--highlight ]  [ bio  bio--long ]"&gt;
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>This is not a firm recommendation, and is something I am still trialling myself,
  but it does carry a number of benefits. Read more in <a href="http://csswizardry.com/2014/05/grouping-related-classes-in-your-markup/"><cite>Grouping related
  classes in your
  markup</cite></a>.</p>

  <p>As with our rulesets, it is possible to use meaningful whitespace in your HTML.
  You can denote thematic breaks in content with five (5) empty lines, for
  example:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;header class="page-head"&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/header&gt;





  &lt;main class="page-content"&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/main&gt;





  &lt;footer class="page-foot"&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/footer&gt;
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Separate independent but loosely related snippets of markup with a single empty
  line, for example:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;ul class="primary-nav"&gt;

    &lt;li class="primary-nav__item"&gt;
      &lt;a href="/" class="primary-nav__link"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li class="primary-nav__item  primary-nav__trigger"&gt;
      &lt;a href="/about" class="primary-nav__link"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;

      &lt;ul class="primary-nav__sub-nav"&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/about/products"&gt;Products&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/about/company"&gt;Company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li class="primary-nav__item"&gt;
      &lt;a href="/contact" class="primary-nav__link"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>This allows developers to spot separate parts of the DOM at a glance, and also
  allows certain text editors—like Vim, for example—to manipulate
  empty-line-delimited blocks of markup.</p>

  <h2 id="commenting">Commenting</h2>

  <p>The cognitive overhead of working with CSS is huge. With so much to be aware of,
  and so many project-specific nuances to remember, the worst situation most
  developers find themselves in is being the-person-who-didn’t-write-this-code.
  Remembering your own classes, rules, objects, and helpers is manageable <em>to an
  extent</em>, but anyone inheriting CSS barely stands a chance.</p>

  <p><strong>CSS needs more comments.</strong></p>

  <p>As CSS is something of a declarative language that doesn’t really leave much of
  a paper-trail, it is often hard to discern—from looking at the CSS alone—</p>

  <ul>
    <li>whether some CSS relies on other code elsewhere;</li>
    <li>what effect changing some code will have elsewhere;</li>
    <li>where else some CSS might be used;</li>
    <li>what styles something might inherit (intentionally or otherwise);</li>
    <li>what styles something might pass on (intentionally or otherwise);</li>
    <li>where the author intended a piece of CSS to be used.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This doesn’t even take into account some of CSS’ many quirks—such as various
  sates of <code class="highlighter-rouge">overflow</code> triggering block formatting context, or certain transform
  properties triggering hardware acceleration—that make it even more baffling to
  developers inheriting projects.</p>

  <p>As a result of CSS not telling its own story very well, it is a language that
  really does benefit from being heavily commented.</p>

  <p>As a rule, you should comment anything that isn’t immediately obvious from the
  code alone. That is to say, there is no need to tell someone that <code class="highlighter-rouge">color: red;</code>
  will make something red, but if you’re using <code class="highlighter-rouge">overflow: hidden;</code> to clear
  floats—as opposed to clipping an element’s overflow—this is probably something
  worth documenting.</p>

  <h3 id="high-level">High-level</h3>

  <p>For large comments that document entire sections or components, we use a
  DocBlock-esque multi-line comment which adheres to our 80 column width.</p>

  <p>Here is a real-life example from the CSS which styles the page header on <a href="http://csswizardry.com/">CSS
  Wizardry</a>:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>/**
  * The site’s main page-head can have two different states:
  *
  * 1) Regular page-head with no backgrounds or extra treatments; it just
  *    contains the logo and nav.
  * 2) A masthead that has a fluid-height (becoming fixed after a certain point)
  *    which has a large background image, and some supporting text.
  *
  * The regular page-head is incredibly simple, but the masthead version has some
  * slightly intermingled dependency with the wrapper that lives inside it.
  */
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>This level of detail should be the norm for all non-trivial code—descriptions of
  states, permutations, conditions, and treatments.</p>

  <h4 id="objectextension-pointers">Object–Extension Pointers</h4>

  <p>When working across multiple partials, or in an OOCSS manner, you will often
  find that rulesets that can work in conjunction with each other are not always
  in the same file or location. For example, you may have a generic button
  object—which provides purely structural styles—which is to be extended in a
  component-level partial which will add cosmetics. We document this relationship
  across files with simple <i>object–extension pointers</i>. In the object file:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>/**
  * Extend `.btn {}` in _components.buttons.scss.
  */

  .btn { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>And in your theme file:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>/**
  * These rules extend `.btn {}` in _objects.buttons.scss.
  */

  .btn--positive { }

  .btn--negative { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>This simple, low effort commenting can make a lot of difference to developers
  who are unaware of relationships across projects, or who are wanting to know
  how, why, and where other styles might be being inherited from.</p>

  <h3 id="low-level">Low-level</h3>

  <p>Oftentimes we want to comment on specific declarations (i.e. lines) in a
  ruleset. To do this we use a kind of reverse footnote. Here is a more complex
  comment detailing the larger site headers mentioned above:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>/**
  * Large site headers act more like mastheads. They have a faux-fluid-height
  * which is controlled by the wrapping element inside it.
  *
  * 1. Mastheads will typically have dark backgrounds, so we need to make sure
  *    the contrast is okay. This value is subject to change as the background
  *    image changes.
  * 2. We need to delegate a lot of the masthead’s layout to its wrapper element
  *    rather than the masthead itself: it is to this wrapper that most things
  *    are positioned.
  * 3. The wrapper needs positioning context for us to lay our nav and masthead
  *    text in.
  * 4. Faux-fluid-height technique: simply create the illusion of fluid height by
  *    creating space via a percentage padding, and then position everything over
  *    the top of that. This percentage gives us a 16:9 ratio.
  * 5. When the viewport is at 758px wide, our 16:9 ratio means that the masthead
  *    is currently rendered at 480px high. Let’s…
  * 6. …seamlessly snip off the fluid feature at this height, and…
  * 7. …fix the height at 480px. This means that we should see no jumps in height
  *    as the masthead moves from fluid to fixed. This actual value takes into
  *    account the padding and the top border on the header itself.
  */

  .page-head--masthead {
    margin-bottom: 0;
    background: url(/img/css/masthead.jpg) center center #2e2620;
    @include vendor(background-size, cover);
    color: $color-masthead; /* [1] */
    border-top-color: $color-masthead;
    border-bottom-width: 0;
    box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) inset;

    @include media-query(lap-and-up) {
      background-image: url(/img/css/masthead-medium.jpg);
    }

      }

    }

  }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>These types of comment allow us to keep all of our documentation in one place
  whilst referring to the parts of the ruleset to which they belong.</p>

  <h3 id="preprocessor-comments">Preprocessor Comments</h3>

  <p>With most—if not all—preprocessors, we have the option to write comments that
  will not get compiled out into our resulting CSS file. As a rule, use these
  comments to document code that would not get written out to that CSS file
  either. If you are documenting code which will get compiled, use comments that
  will compile also. For example, this is correct:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>// Dimensions of the @2x image sprite:
  $sprite-width:  920px;
  $sprite-height: 212px;

  /**
  * 1. Default icon size is 16px.
  * 2. Squash down the retina sprite to display at the correct size.
  */
  .sprite {
    width:  16px; /* [1] */
    height: 16px; /* [1] */
    background-image: url(/img/sprites/main.png);
    background-size: ($sprite-width / 2 ) ($sprite-height / 2); /* [2] */
  }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>We have documented variables—code which will not get compiled into our CSS
  file—with preprocessor comments, whereas our CSS—code which will get compiled
  into our CSS file—is documented using CSS comments. This means that we have only
  the correct and relevant information available to us when debugging our compiled
  stylesheets.</p>

  <h3 id="removing-comments">Removing Comments</h3>

  <p>It should go without saying that no comments should make their way into
  production environments—all CSS should be minified, resulting in loss of
  comments, before being deployed.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2 id="naming-conventions">Naming Conventions</h2>

  <p>Naming conventions in CSS are hugely useful in making your code more
  strict, more transparent, and more informative.</p>

  <p>A good naming convention will tell you and your team</p>

  <ul>
    <li>what type of thing a class does;</li>
    <li>where a class can be used;</li>
    <li>what (else) a class might be related to.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The naming convention I follow is very simple: hyphen (<code class="highlighter-rouge">-</code>) delimited strings,
  with BEM-like naming for more complex pieces of code.</p>

  <p>It’s worth noting that a naming convention is not normally useful CSS-side of
  development; they really come into their own when viewed in HTML.</p>

  <h3 id="hyphen-delimited">Hyphen Delimited</h3>

  <p>All strings in classes are delimited with a hyphen (<code class="highlighter-rouge">-</code>), like so:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.page-head { }

  .sub-content { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Camel case and underscores are not used for regular classes; the following are
  incorrect:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.pageHead { }

  .sub_content { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <h3 id="bem-like-naming">BEM-like Naming</h3>

  <p>For larger, more interrelated pieces of UI that require a number of classes, we
  use a BEM-like naming convention.</p>

  <p><cite>BEM</cite>, meaning <i>Block</i>, <i>Element</i>, <i>Modifier</i>, is a
  front-end methodology coined by developers working at Yandex. Whilst BEM is a
  complete methodology, here we are only concerned with its naming convention.
  Further, the naming convention here only is BEM-<em>like</em>; the principles are
  exactly the same, but the actual syntax differs slightly.</p>

  <p>BEM splits components’ classes into three groups:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Block: The sole root of the component.</li>
    <li>Element: A component part of the Block.</li>
    <li>Modifier: A variant or extension of the Block.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To take an analogy (note, not an example):</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.person { }
  .person__head { }
  .person--tall { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Elements are delimited with two (2) underscores (<code class="highlighter-rouge">__</code>), and Modifiers are
  delimited by two (2) hyphens (<code class="highlighter-rouge">--</code>).</p>

  <p>Here we can see that <code class="highlighter-rouge">.person {}</code> is the Block; it is the sole root of a
  discrete entity. <code class="highlighter-rouge">.person__head {}</code> is an Element; it is a smaller part of the
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">.person {}</code> Block. Finally, <code class="highlighter-rouge">.person--tall {}</code> is a Modifier; it is a specific
  variant of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.person {}</code> Block.</p>

  <h4 id="starting-context">Starting Context</h4>

  <p>Your Block context starts at the most logical, self-contained, discrete
  location. To continue with our person-based analogy, we’d not have a class like
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">.room__person {}</code>, as the room is another, much higher context. We’d probably
  have separate Blocks, like so:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.room { }

    .room__door { }

  .room--kitchen { }


  .person { }

    .person__head { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>If we did want to denote a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.person {}</code> inside a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.room {}</code>, it is more correct
  to use a selector like <code class="highlighter-rouge">.room .person {}</code> which bridges two Blocks than it is to
  increase the scope of existing Blocks and Elements.</p>

  <p>A more realistic example of properly scoped blocks might look something like
  this, where each chunk of code represents its own Block:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.page { }


  .content { }


  .sub-content { }


  .footer { }

    .footer__copyright { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Incorrect notation for this would be:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.page { }

    .page__content { }

    .page__sub-content { }

    .page__footer { }

      .page__copyright { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>It is important to know when BEM scope starts and stops. As a rule, BEM applies
  to self-contained, discrete parts of the UI.</p>

  <div class="box  box--promo  box--outdent">
      <p>Something you need some more help with?</p>
      <p><a href="http://csswizardry.com/work/" class="btn  btn--full  btn--tertiary">Hire me</a></p>
  </div>

  <h4 id="more-layers">More Layers</h4>

  <p>If we were to add another Element—called, let’s say, <code class="highlighter-rouge">.person__eye {}</code>—to this
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">.person {}</code> component, we would not need to step through every layer of the
  DOM. That is to say, the correct notation would be <code class="highlighter-rouge">.person__eye {}</code>, and not
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">.person__head__eye {}</code>. Your classes do not reflect the full paper-trail of the
  DOM.</p>

  <h4 id="modifying-elements">Modifying Elements</h4>

  <p>You can have variants of Elements, and these can be denoted in a number of ways
  depending on how and why they are being modified. Carrying on with our person
  example, a blue eye might look like this:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.person__eye--blue { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Here we can see we’re directly modifying the eye Element.</p>

  <p>Things can get more complex, however. Please excuse the crude analogy, and let’s
  imagine we have a face Element that is handsome. The person themselves isn’t
  that handsome, so we modify the face Element directly—a handsome face on a
  regular person:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.person__face--handsome { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>But what if that person <em>is</em> handsome, and we want to style their face because
  of that fact? A regular face on a handsome person:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.person--handsome .person__face { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Here is one of a few occasions where we’d use a descendant selector to modify
  an Element based on a Modifier on the Block.</p>

  <p>If using Sass, we would likely write this like so:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.person { }

    .person__face {

      .person--handsome &amp; { }

    }

  .person--handsome { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Note that we do not nest a new instance of <code class="highlighter-rouge">.person__face {}</code> inside of
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">.person--handsome {}</code>; instead, we make use of Sass’ parent selectors to
  prepend <code class="highlighter-rouge">.person--handsome</code> onto the existing <code class="highlighter-rouge">.person__face {}</code> selector. This
  means that all of our <code class="highlighter-rouge">.person__face {}</code>-related rules exist in once place, and
  aren’t spread throughout the file. This is general good practice when dealing
  with nested code: keep all of your context (e.g. all <code class="highlighter-rouge">.person__face {}</code> code)
  encapsulated in one location.</p>

  <h3 id="naming-conventions-in-html">Naming Conventions in HTML</h3>

  <p>As I previously hinted at, naming conventions aren’t necessarily all that useful
  in your CSS. Where naming conventions’ power really lies is in your markup. Take
  the following, non-naming-conventioned HTML:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;div class="box  profile  pro-user"&gt;

    &lt;img class="avatar  image" /&gt;

    &lt;p class="bio"&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>How are the classes <code class="highlighter-rouge">box</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">profile</code> related to each other? How are the
  classes <code class="highlighter-rouge">profile</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">avatar</code> related to each other? Are they related at all?
  Should you be using <code class="highlighter-rouge">pro-user</code> alongside <code class="highlighter-rouge">bio</code>? Will the classes <code class="highlighter-rouge">image</code> and
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">profile</code> live in the same part of the CSS? Can you use <code class="highlighter-rouge">avatar</code> anywhere else?</p>

  <p>From that markup alone, it is very hard to answer any of those questions. Using
  a naming convention, however, changes all that:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;div class="box  profile  profile--is-pro-user"&gt;

    &lt;img class="avatar  profile__image" /&gt;

    &lt;p class="profile__bio"&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Now we can clearly see which classes are and are not related to each other, and
  how; we know what classes we can’t use outside of the scope of this component;
  and we know which classes we may be free to reuse elsewhere.</p>

  <h3 id="javascript-hooks">JavaScript Hooks</h3>

  <p>As a rule, it is unwise to bind your CSS and your JS onto the same class in your
  HTML. This is because doing so means you can’t have (or remove) one without
  (removing) the other. It is much cleaner, much more transparent, and much more
  maintainable to bind your JS onto specific classes.</p>

  <p>I have known occasions before when trying to refactor some CSS has unwittingly
  removed JS functionality because the two were tied to each other—it was
  impossible to have one without the other.</p>

  <p>Typically, these are classes that are prepended with <code class="highlighter-rouge">js-</code>, for example:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;input type="submit" class="btn  js-btn" value="Follow" /&gt;
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>This means that we can have an element elsewhere which can carry with style of
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">.btn {}</code>, but without the behaviour of <code class="highlighter-rouge">.js-btn</code>.</p>

  <h4 id="data--attributes"><code class="highlighter-rouge">data-*</code> Attributes</h4>

  <p>A common practice is to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">data-*</code> attributes as JS hooks, but this is
  incorrect. <code class="highlighter-rouge">data-*</code> attributes, as per the spec, are used <q><strong>to store custom
  data</strong> private to the page or application</q> (emphasis mine). <code class="highlighter-rouge">data-*</code>
  attributes are designed to store data, not be bound to.</p>

  <h3 id="taking-it-further">Taking It Further</h3>

  <p>As previously mentioned, these are very simple naming conventions, and ones that
  don’t do much more than denote three distinct groups of class.</p>

  <p>I would encourage you to read up on and further look in to your naming
  convention in order to provide more functionality—I know it’s something I’m keen
  to research and investigate further.</p>

  <h2 id="css-selectors">CSS Selectors</h2>

  <p>Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, one of the most fundamental, critical aspects of
  writing maintainable and scalable CSS is selectors. Their specificity, their
  portability, and their reusability all have a direct impact on the mileage we
  will get out of our CSS, and the headaches it might bring us.</p>

  <h3 id="selector-intent">Selector Intent</h3>

  <p>It is important when writing CSS that we scope our selectors correctly, and that
  we’re selecting the right things for the right reasons. <i>Selector Intent</i>
  is the process of deciding and defining what you want to style and how you
  will go about selecting it. For example, if you are wanting to style your
  website’s main navigation menu, a selector like this would be incredibly unwise:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>header ul { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>This selector’s intent is to style any <code class="highlighter-rouge">ul</code> inside any <code class="highlighter-rouge">header</code> element, whereas
  <em>our</em> intent was to style the site’s main navigation. This is poor Selector
  Intent: you can have any number of <code class="highlighter-rouge">header</code> elements on a page, and they in turn
  can house any number of <code class="highlighter-rouge">ul</code>s, so a selector like this runs the risk of applying
  very specific styling to a very wide number of elements. This will result in
  having to write more CSS to undo the greedy nature of such a selector.</p>

  <p>A better approach would be a selector like:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.site-nav { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>An unambiguous, explicit selector with good Selector Intent. We are explicitly
  selecting the right thing for exactly the right reason.</p>

  <p>Poor Selector Intent is one of the biggest reasons for headaches on CSS
  projects. Writing rules that are far too greedy—and that apply very specific
  treatments via very far reaching selectors—causes unexpected side effects and
  leads to very tangled stylesheets, with selectors overstepping their intentions
  and impacting and interfering with otherwise unrelated rulesets.</p>

  <p>CSS cannot be encapsulated, it is inherently leaky, but we can mitigate some of
  these effects by not writing such globally-operating selectors: <strong>your selectors
  should be as explicit and well reasoned as your reason for wanting to select
  something.</strong></p>

  <h3 id="reusability">Reusability</h3>

  <p>With a move toward a more component-based approach to constructing UIs, the idea
  of reusability is paramount. We want the option to be able to move, recycle,
  duplicate, and syndicate components across our projects.</p>

  <p>To this end, we make heavy use of classes. IDs, as well as being hugely
  over-specific, cannot be used more than once on any given page, whereas classes
  can be reused an infinite amount of times. Everything you choose, from the type
  of selector to its name, should lend itself toward being reused.</p>

  <h3 id="location-independence">Location Independence</h3>

  <p>Given the ever-changing nature of most UI projects, and the move to more
  component-based architectures, it is in our interests not to style things based
  on where they are, but on <em>what</em> they are. That is to say, our components’
  styling should not be reliant upon where we place them—they should remain
  entirely location independent.</p>

  <p>Let’s take an example of a call-to-action button that we have chosen to style
  via the following selector:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.promo a { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Not only does this have poor Selector Intent—it will greedily style any and
  every link inside of a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.promo</code> to look like a button—it is also pretty wasteful
  as a result of being so locationally dependent: we can’t reuse that button with
  its correct styling outside of <code class="highlighter-rouge">.promo</code> because it is explicitly tied to that
  location. A far better selector would have been:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.btn { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>This single class can be reused anywhere outside of <code class="highlighter-rouge">.promo</code> and will always
  carry its correct styling. As a result of a better selector, this piece of UI is
  more portable, more recyclable, doesn’t have any dependencies, and has much
  better Selector Intent. <strong>A component shouldn’t have to live in a certain place
  to look a certain way.</strong></p>

  <h3 id="portability">Portability</h3>

  <p>Reducing, or, ideally, removing, location dependence means that we can move
  components around our markup more freely, but how about improving our ability to
  move classes around components? On a much lower level, there are changes we
  can make to our selectors that make the selectors themselves—as opposed to the
  components they create—more portable. Take the following example:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>input.btn { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>This is a <i>qualified</i> selector; the leading <code class="highlighter-rouge">input</code> ties this ruleset to
  only being able to work on <code class="highlighter-rouge">input</code> elements. By omitting this qualification, we
  allow ourselves to reuse the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.btn</code> class on any element we choose, like an <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code>,
  for example, or a <code class="highlighter-rouge">button</code>.</p>

  <p>Qualified selectors do not lend themselves well to being reused, and every
  selector we write should be authored with reuse in mind.</p>

  <p>Of course, there are times when you may want to legitimately qualify a
  selector—you might need to apply some very specific styling to a particular
  element when it carries a certain class, for example:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>/**
  * Embolden and colour any element with a class of `.error`.
  */
  .error {
    color: red;
    font-weight: bold;
  }

  /**
  * If the element is a `div`, also give it some box-like styling.
  */
  div.error {
    padding: 10px;
    border: 1px solid;
  }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>This is one example where a qualified selector might be justifiable, but I would
  still recommend an approach more like:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>/**
  * Text-level errors.
  */
  .error-text {
    color: red;
    font-weight: bold;
  }

  /**
  * Elements that contain errors.
  */
  .error-box {
    padding: 10px;
    border: 1px solid;
  }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>This means that we can apply <code class="highlighter-rouge">.error-box</code> to any element, and not just a
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">div</code>—it is more reusable than a qualified selector.</p>

  <h4 id="quasi-qualified-selectors">Quasi-Qualified Selectors</h4>

  <p>One thing that qualified selectors can be useful for is signalling where a class
  might be expected or intended to be used, for example:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>ul.nav { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Here we can see that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.nav</code> class is meant to be used on a <code class="highlighter-rouge">ul</code> element, and
  not on a <code class="highlighter-rouge">nav</code>. By using <i>quasi-qualified selectors</i> we can still provide
  that information without actually qualifying the selector:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>/*ul*/.nav { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>By commenting out the leading element, we can still leave it to be read, but
  avoid qualifying and increasing the specificity of the selector.</p>

  <h3 id="naming">Naming</h3>

  <p>As Phil Karlton once said, <q>There are only two hard things in Computer
  Science: cache invalidation and naming things.</q></p>

  <p>I won’t comment on the former claim here, but the latter has plagued me for
  years.  My advice with regard to naming things in CSS is to pick a name that is
  sensible, but somewhat ambiguous: aim for high reusability. For example, instead
  of a class like <code class="highlighter-rouge">.site-nav</code>, choose something like <code class="highlighter-rouge">.primary-nav</code>; rather than
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">.footer-links</code>, favour a class like <code class="highlighter-rouge">.sub-links</code>.</p>

  <p>The differences in these names is that the first of each two examples is tied to
  a very specific use case: they can only be used as the site’s navigation or the
  footer’s links respectively. By using slightly more ambiguous names, we can
  increase our ability to reuse these components in different circumstances.</p>

  <p>To quote Nicolas Gallagher:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Tying your class name semantics tightly to the nature of the content has already
  reduced the ability of your architecture to scale or be easily put to use by
  other developers.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>That is to say, we should use sensible names—classes like <code class="highlighter-rouge">.border</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">.red</code>
  are never advisable—but we should avoid using classes which describe the exact
  nature of the content and/or its use cases. <strong>Using a class name to describe
  content is redundant because content describes itself.</strong></p>

  <p>The debate surrounding semantics has raged for years, but it is important that
  we adopt a more pragmatic, sensible approach to naming things in order to work
  more efficiently and effectively. Instead of focussing on ‘semantics’, look more
  closely at sensibility and longevity—choose names based on ease of maintenance,
  not for their perceived meaning.</p>

  <p>Name things for people; they’re the only things that actually <em>read</em> your
  classes (everything else merely matches them). Once again, it is better to
  strive for reusable, recyclable classes rather than writing for specific use
  cases. Let’s take an example:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>/**
  * Runs the risk of becoming out of date; not very maintainable.
  */
  .blue {
    color: blue;
  }

  /**
  * Depends on location in order to be rendered properly.
  */
  .header span {
    color: blue;
  }

  /**
  * Too specific; limits our ability to reuse.
  */
  .header-color {
    color: blue;
  }

  /**
  * Nicely abstracted, very portable, doesn’t risk becoming out of date.
  */
  .highlight-color {
    color: blue;
  }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>It is important to strike a balance between names that do not literally describe
  the style that the class brings, but also ones that do not explicitly describe
  specific use cases. Instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">.home-page-panel</code>, choose <code class="highlighter-rouge">.masthead</code>; instead
  of <code class="highlighter-rouge">.site-nav</code>, favour <code class="highlighter-rouge">.primary-nav</code>; instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">.btn-login</code>, opt for
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">.btn-primary</code>.</p>

  <h4 id="naming-ui-components">Naming UI Components</h4>

  <p>Naming components with agnosticism and reusability in mind really helps
  developers construct and modify UIs much more quickly, and with far less waste.
  However, it can sometimes be beneficial to provide more specific or meaningful
  naming alongside the more ambiguous class, particularly when several agnostic
  classes come together to form a more complex and specific component that might
  benefit from having a more meaningful name. In this scenario, we augment the
  classes with a  <code class="highlighter-rouge">data-ui-component</code> attribute which houses a more specific name,
  for example:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;ul class="tabbed-nav" data-ui-component="Main Nav"&gt;
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Here we have the benefits of a highly reusable class name which does not
  describe—and, therefore, tie itself to—a specific use case, and added meaning
  via our <code class="highlighter-rouge">data-ui-component</code> attribute. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">data-ui-component</code>’s value can take
  any format you wish, like title case:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;ul class="tabbed-nav" data-ui-component="Main Nav"&gt;
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Or class-like:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;ul class="tabbed-nav" data-ui-component="main-nav"&gt;
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Or namespaced:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;ul class="tabbed-nav" data-ui-component="nav-main"&gt;
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>The implementation is largely personal preference, but the concept still
  remains: <strong>Add any useful or specific meaning via a mechanism that will not
  inhibit your and your team’s ability to recycle and reuse CSS.</strong></p>

  <div class="box  box--promo  box--outdent">

  <h3 id="selector-performance">Selector Performance</h3>

  <p>A topic which is—with the quality of today’s browsers—more interesting than it
  is important, is selector performance. That is to say, how quickly a browser can
  match the selectors your write in CSS up with the nodes it finds in the DOM.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, the longer a selector is (i.e. the more component parts) the
  slower it is, for example:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>body.home div.header ul { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>…is a far less efficient selector than:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.primary-nav { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>This is because browsers read CSS selectors <strong>right-to-left</strong>. A browser will
  read the first selector as</p>

  <ul>
    <li>find all <code class="highlighter-rouge">ul</code> elements in the DOM;</li>
    <li>now check if they live anywhere inside an element with a class of <code class="highlighter-rouge">.header</code>;</li>
    <li>next check that <code class="highlighter-rouge">.header</code> class exists on a <code class="highlighter-rouge">div</code> element;</li>
    <li>now check that that all lives anywhere inside any elements with a class of
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">.home</code>;</li>
    <li>finally, check that <code class="highlighter-rouge">.home</code> exists on a <code class="highlighter-rouge">body</code> element.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The second, in contrast, is simply a case of the browser reading</p>

  <ul>
    <li>find all the elements with a class of <code class="highlighter-rouge">.primary-nav</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To further compound the problem, we are using descendant selectors (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">.foo
  .bar {}</code>). The upshot of this is that a browser is required to start with the
  rightmost part of the selector (i.e. <code class="highlighter-rouge">.bar</code>) and keep looking up the DOM
  indefinitely until it finds the next part (i.e. <code class="highlighter-rouge">.foo</code>). This could mean
  stepping up the DOM dozens of times until a match is found.</p>

  <p>This is just one reason why <strong>nesting with preprocessors is often a false
  economy</strong>; as well as making selectors unnecessarily more specific, and creating
  location dependency, it also creates more work for the browser.</p>

  <p>By using a child selector (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">.foo &gt; .bar {}</code>) we can make the process much
  more efficient, because this only requires the browser to look one level higher
  in the DOM, and it will stop regardless of whether or not it found a match.</p>

  <h4 id="the-key-selector">The Key Selector</h4>

  <p>Because browsers read selectors right-to-left, the rightmost selector is often
  critical in defining a selector’s performance: this is called the <i>key
  selector</i>.</p>

  <p>The following selector might appear to be highly performant at first glance. It
  uses an ID which is nice and fast, and there can only ever be one on a page, so
  surely this will be a nice and speedy lookup—just find that one ID and then
  style everything inside of it:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>#foo * { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>The problem with this selector is that the key selector (<code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code>) is very, <em>very</em>
  far reaching. What this selector actually does is find <em>every single</em> node in
  the DOM (even <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;title&gt;</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;link&gt;</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;head&gt;</code> elements; <em>everything</em>) and then
  looks to see if it lives anywhere at any level within <code class="highlighter-rouge">#foo</code>. This is a very,
  <em>very</em> expensive selector, and should most likely be avoided or rewritten.</p>

  <p>Thankfully, by writing selectors with good <a href="#selector-intent">Selector Intent</a>,
  we are probably avoiding inefficient selectors by default; we are very unlikely
  to have greedy key selectors if we’re targeting the right things for the right
  reason.</p>

  <p>That said, however, CSS selector performance should be fairly low on your list
  of things to optimise; browsers are fast, and are only ever getting faster, and
  it is only on notable edge cases that inefficient selectors would be likely to
  pose a problem.</p>

  <p>As well as their own specific issues, nesting, qualifying, and poor Selector
  Intent all contribute to less efficient selectors.</p>

  <h3 id="general-rules">General Rules</h3>

  <p>Your selectors are fundamental to writing good CSS. To very briefly sum up the
  above sections:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Select what you want explicitly</strong>, rather than relying on circumstance or
  coincidence. Good Selector Intent will rein in the reach and leak of your
  styles.</li>
    <li><strong>Write selectors for reusability</strong>, so that you can work more efficiently and
  reduce waste and repetition.</li>
    <li><strong>Do not nest selectors unnecessarily</strong>, because this will increase
  specificity and affect where else you can use your styles.</li>
    <li><strong>Do not qualify selectors unnecessarily</strong>, as this will impact the number of
  different elements you can apply styles to.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep selectors as short as possible</strong>, in order to keep specificity down and
  performance up.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Focussing on these points will keep your selectors a lot more sane and easy to
  work with on changing and long-running projects.</p>

  <h2 id="specificity">Specificity</h2>

  <p>As we’ve seen, CSS isn’t the most friendly of languages: globally operating,
  very leaky, dependent on location, hard to encapsulate, based on inheritance…
  But! None of that even comes close to the horrors of specificity.</p>

  <p>No matter how well considered your naming, regardless of how perfect your source
  order and cascade are managed, and how well you’ve scoped your rulesets, just
  one overly-specific selector can undo everything. It is a gigantic curveball,
  and undermines CSS’ very nature of the cascade, inheritance, and source order.</p>

  <p>The problem with specificity is that it sets precedents and trumps that cannot
  <em>simply</em> be undone. If we take a real example that I was responsible for some
  years ago:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>#content table { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Not only does this exhibit poor <a href="#selector-intent">Selector Intent</a>—I didn’t
  actually want every <code class="highlighter-rouge">table</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">#content</code> area, I wanted a specific type of
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">table</code> that just happened to live there—it is a hugely over-specific selector.
  This became apparent a number of weeks later, when I needed a second type of
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">table</code>:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>#content table { }

  /**
  * Uh oh! My styles get overwritten by `#content table {}`.
  */
  .my-new-table { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>The first selector was trumping the specificity of the one defined <em>after</em> it,
  working against CSS’ source-order based application of styles. In order to
  remedy this, I had two main options. I could</p>

  <ol>
    <li>refactor my CSS and HTML to remove that ID;</li>
    <li>write a more specific selector to override it.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Unfortunately, refactoring would have taken a long time; it was a mature product
  and the knock-on effects of removing this ID would have been a more substantial
  business cost than the second option: just write a more specific selector.</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>#content table { }

  #content .my-new-table { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Now I have a selector that is <em>even more specific still!</em> And if I ever want to
  override this one, I will need another selector of at least the same specificity
  defined after it. I’ve started on a downward spiral.</p>

  <p>Specificity can, among other things,</p>

  <ul>
    <li>limit your ability to extend and manipulate a codebase;</li>
    <li>interrupt and undo CSS’ cascading, inheriting nature;</li>
    <li>cause avoidable verbosity in your project;</li>
    <li>prevent things from working as expected when moved into different
  environments;</li>
    <li>lead to serious developer frustration.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All of these issues are greatly magnified when working on a larger project with
  a number of developers contributing code.</p>

  <h3 id="keep-it-low-at-all-times">Keep It Low at All Times</h3>

  <p>The problem with specificity isn’t necessarily that it’s high or low; it’s the
  fact it is so variant and that it cannot be opted out of: the only way to deal
  with it is to get progressively more specific—the notorious <i>specificity
  wars</i> we looked at above.</p>

  <p>One of the single, simplest tips for an easier life when writing
  CSS—particularly at any reasonable scale—is to keep always try and keep
  specificity as low as possible at all times. Try to make sure there isn’t a lot
  of variance between selectors in your codebase, and that all selectors strive
  for as low a specificity as possible.</p>

  <p>Doing so will instantly help you tame and manage your project, meaning that no
  overly-specific selectors are likely to impact or affect anything of a lower
  specificity elsewhere. It also means you’re less likely to need to fight your
  way out of specificity corners, and you’ll probably also be writing much smaller
  stylesheets.</p>

  <p>Simple changes to the way we work include, but are not limited to,</p>

  <ul>
    <li>not using IDs in your CSS;</li>
    <li>not nesting selectors;</li>
    <li>not qualifying classes;</li>
    <li>not chaining selectors.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Specificity can be wrangled and understood, but it is safer just to avoid it
  entirely.</strong></p>

  <h3 id="ids-in-css">IDs in CSS</h3>

  <p>If we want to keep specificity low, which we do, we have one really quick-win,
  simple, easy-to-follow rule that we can employ to help us: avoid using IDs in CSS.</p>

  <p>Not only are IDs inherently non-reusable, they are also vastly more specific
  than any other selector, and therefore become specificity anomalies. Where the
  rest of your selectors are relatively low specificity, your ID-based selectors
  are, comparatively, much, <em>much</em> higher.</p>

  <p>In fact, to highlight the severity of this difference, see how <em>one thousand</em>
  chained classes cannot override the specificity of a single ID:
  <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/csswizardry/0yb7rque/">jsfiddle.net/0yb7rque</a>.
  <small>(Please note that in Firefox you may see the text rendering in blue: this
  is a <a href="https://twitter.com/codepo8/status/505004085398224896">known bug</a>, and an
  ID will be overridden by 256 chained classes.)</small></p>

  <p><small><strong>N.B.</strong> It is still perfectly okay to use IDs in HTML and JavaScript; it
  is only in CSS that they prove troublesome.</small></p>

  <p>It is often suggested that developers who choose not to use IDs in CSS merely
  <q>don’t understand how specificity works</q>. This is as incorrect as it is
  offensive: no matter how experienced a developer you are, this behaviour cannot
  be circumvented; no amount of knowledge will make an ID less specific.</p>

  <p>Opting into this way of working only introduces the chance of problems occurring
  further down the line, and—particularly when working at scale—all efforts should
  be made to <em>avoid</em> the potential for problems to arise. In a sentence:</p>

  <p><strong>It is just not worth introducing the risk.</strong></p>

  <h3 id="nesting">Nesting</h3>

  <p>We’ve already looked at how nesting can lead to location dependent and
  potentially inefficient code, but now it’s time to take a look at another of its
  pitfalls: it makes selectors more specific.</p>

  <p>When we talk about nesting, we don’t necessarily mean preprocessor nesting, like
  so:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.foo {

    .bar { }

  }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>We’re actually talking about <em>descendant</em> or <em>child</em> selectors; selectors which
  rely on a thing within a thing. That could look like any one of the following:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>/**
  * An element with a class of `.bar` anywhere inside an element with a class of
  * `.foo`.
  */
  .foo .bar { }


  /**
  * An element with a class of `.module-title` directly inside an element with a
  * class of `.module`.
  */
  .module &gt; .module-title { }


  /**
  * Any `li` element anywhere inside a `ul` element anywhere inside a `nav`
  * element
  */
  nav ul li { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Whether you arrive at this CSS via a preprocessor or not isn’t particularly
  important, but it is worth noting that <strong>preprocessors tout this as a feature,
  where is actually to be avoided wherever possible</strong>.</p>

  <p>Generally speaking, each part in a compound selector adds specificity. Ergo, the
  fewer parts to a compound selector then the lower its overall specificity, and
  we always want to keep specificity low. To quote Jonathan Snook:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>…whenever declaring your styles, <strong>use the least number of selectors required
  to style an element.</strong></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Let’s look at an example:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.widget {
    padding: 10px;
  }

    .widget &gt; .widget__title {
      color: red;
    }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>To style an element with a class of <code class="highlighter-rouge">.widget__title</code>, we have a selector that is
  twice as specific as it needs to be. That means that if we want to make any
  modifications to <code class="highlighter-rouge">.widget__title</code>, we’ll need another at-least-equally specific
  selector:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.widget { ... }

    .widget &gt; .widget__title { ... }

    .widget &gt; .widget__title--sub {
      color: blue;
    }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Not only is this entirely avoidable—we caused this problem ourselves—we have a
  selector that is literally double the specificity it needs to be. We used 200%
  of the specificity actually required. And not only <em>that</em>, but this also leads
  to needless verbosity in our code—more to send over the wire.</p>

  <p>As a rule, <strong>if a selector will work without it being nested then do not nest
  it</strong>.</p>

  <h4 id="scope">Scope</h4>

  <p>One possible advantage of nesting—which, unfortunately, does not outweigh the
  disadvantages of increased specificity—is that it provides us with a namespace
  of sorts. A selector like <code class="highlighter-rouge">.widget .title</code> scopes the styling of <code class="highlighter-rouge">.title</code> to
  an element that only exists inside of an element carrying a class of <code class="highlighter-rouge">.widget</code>.</p>

  <p>This goes some way to providing our CSS with scope and encapsulation, but does
  still mean that our selectors are twice as specific as they need to be. A better
  way of providing this scope would be via a namespace—which we already have in
  the form of <a href="#bem-like-naming">BEM-like Naming</a>—which does not lead to an
  unnecessary increase in specificity.</p>

  <p>Now we have better scoped CSS with minimal specificity—the best of both worlds.</p>

  </ul>

  <h3 id="important"><code class="highlighter-rouge">!important</code></h3>

  <p>The word <code class="highlighter-rouge">!important</code> sends shivers down the spines of almost all front-end
  developers. <code class="highlighter-rouge">!important</code> is a direct manifestation of problems with specificity;
  it is a way of cheating your way out of specificity wars, but usually comes at a
  heavy price. It is often viewed as a last resort—a desperate, defeated stab at
  patching over the symptoms of a much bigger problem with your code.</p>

  <p>The general rule is that <code class="highlighter-rouge">!important</code> is always a bad thing, but, to quote Jamie
  Mason:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Rules are the children of principles.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>That is to say, a single rule is a simple, black-and-white way of adhering to a
  much larger principle. When you’re starting out, the rule <q>never use
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">!important</code></q> is a good one.</p>

  <p>However, once you begin to grow and mature as a developer, you begin to
  understand that the principle behind that rule is simply about keeping
  specificity low. You’ll also learn when and where the rules can be bent…</p>

  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">!important</code> does have a place in CSS projects, but only if used sparingly and
  proactively.</p>

  <p>Proactive use of <code class="highlighter-rouge">!important</code> is when it is used <em>before</em> you’ve encountered any
  specificity problems; when it is used as a guarantee rather than as a fix. For
  example:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.one-half {
    width: 50% !important;
  }

  .hidden {
    display: none !important;
  }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>These two helper, or <i>utility</i>, classes are very specific in their
  intentions: you would only use them if you wanted something to be rendered at
  50% width or not rendered at all. If you didn’t want this behaviour, you would
  not use these classes, therefore whenever you do use them you will definitely
  want them to win.</p>

  <p>Here we proactively apply <code class="highlighter-rouge">!important</code> to ensure that these styles always win.
  This is correct use of <code class="highlighter-rouge">!important</code> to guarantee that these trumps always work,
  and don’t accidentally get overridden by something else more specific.</p>

  <p>Incorrect, <i>reactive</i> use of <code class="highlighter-rouge">!important</code> is when it is used to combat
  specificity problems after the fact: applying <code class="highlighter-rouge">!important</code> to declarations
  because of poorly architected CSS. For example, let’s imagine we have this HTML:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;div class="content"&gt;
    &lt;h2 class="heading-sub"&gt;...&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>…and this CSS:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.content h2 {
    font-size: 2em;
  }

  .heading-sub {
    font-size: 1.5em !important;
  }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Here we can see how we’ve used <code class="highlighter-rouge">!important</code> to force our <code class="highlighter-rouge">.heading-sub {}</code>
  styles to reactively override our <code class="highlighter-rouge">.content h2 {}</code> selector. This could have
  been circumvented by any number of things, including using better Selector
  Intent, or avoiding nesting.</p>

  <p>In these situations, it is preferable that you investigate and refactor any
  offending rulesets to try and bring specificity down across the board, as
  opposed to introducing such specificity heavyweights.</p>

  <p><strong>Only use <code class="highlighter-rouge">!important</code> proactively, not reactively.</strong></p>

  <h3 id="hacking-specificity">Hacking Specificity</h3>

  <p>With all that said on the topic of specificity, and keeping it low, it is
  inevitable that we will encounter problems. No matter how hard we try, and how
  conscientious we are, there will always be times that we need to hack and
  wrangle specificity.</p>

  <p>When these situations do arise, it is important that we handle the hacks as
  safely and elegantly as possible.</p>

  <p>In the event that you need to increase the specificity of a class selector,
  there are a number of options. We could nest the class inside something else to
  bring its specificity up. For example, we could use <code class="highlighter-rouge">.header .site-nav {}</code> to
  bring up the specificity of a simple <code class="highlighter-rouge">.site-nav {}</code> selector.</p>

  <p>The problem with this, as we’ve discussed, is that it introduces location
  dependency: these styles will only work when the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.site-nav</code> component is in the
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">.header</code> component.</p>

  <p>Instead, we can use a much safer hack that will not impact this component’s
  portability: we can chain that class with itself:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.site-nav.site-nav { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>This chaining doubles the specificity of the selector, but does not introduce
  any dependency on location.</p>

  <p>In the event that we do, for whatever reason, have an ID in our markup that we
  cannot replace with a class, select it via an attribute selector as opposed to
  an ID selector. For example, let’s imagine we have embedded a third-party widget
  on our page. We can style the widget via the markup that it outputs, but we have
  no ability to edit that markup ourselves:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;div id="third-party-widget"&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/div&gt;
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Even though we know not to use IDs in CSS, what other option do we have? We want
  to style this HTML but have no access to it, and all it has on it is an ID.</p>

  <p>We do this:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[id="third-party-widget"] { }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Here we are selecting based on an attribute rather than an ID, and attribute
  selectors have the same specificity as a class. This allows us to style based on
  an ID, but without introducing its specificity.</p>

  <p>Do keep in mind that these <em>are</em> hacks, and should not be used unless you have
  no better alternative.</p>

  <h2 id="architectural-principles">Architectural Principles</h2>

  <p>You would be forgiven for thinking that an architecture for CSS is a somewhat
  grandiose and unnecessary concept: why would something so simple, so
  <em>straightforward</em>, need something as complex or considered as an architecture?!</p>

  <p>Well, as we’ve seen, CSS’ simplicity, its looseness, and its unruly nature mean
  that the best way of managing (read, taming) it at any reasonable scale is
  through a strict and specific architecture. A solid architecture can help us
  control our specificity, enforce naming conventions, manage our source order,
  create a sane development environment, and generally make managing our CSS
  projects a lot more consistent and comfortable.</p>

  <p>There is no tool, no preprocessor, no magic bullet, that will make your CSS
  better on its own: a developer’s best tool when working with such a loose syntax
  is self-discipline, conscientiousness, and diligence, and a well-defined
  architecture will help enforce and facilitate these traits.</p>

  <p>Architectures are large, overarching, principle-led collections of smaller
  conventions which come together to provide a managed environment in which code
  is written and maintained. Architectures are typically quite high level, and
  leave implementation details—such as naming conventions or syntax and
  formatting, for example—to the team implementing it.</p>

  <p>Most architectures are usually based around existing design patterns and
  paradigms, and, more often than not, these paradigms were born of computer
  scientists and software engineers. For all CSS isn’t ‘code’, and doesn’t exhibit
  many traits that programming languages do, we find that we can apply some of
  these same principles to our own work.</p>

  <p>In this section, we’ll take a look at some of these design patterns and
  paradigms, and how we can use them to reduce code—and increase code reuse—in our
  CSS projects.</p>

  <h3 id="high-level-overview">High-level Overview</h3>

  <p>At a very high-level, your architecture should help you</p>

  <ul>
    <li>provide a consistent and sane environment;</li>
    <li>accommodate change;</li>
    <li>grow and scale your codebase;</li>
    <li>promote reuse and efficiency;</li>
    <li>increase productivity.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Typically, this will mean a class-based and componentised architecture, split up
  into manageable modules, probably using a preprocessor. Of course, there is far
  more to an architecture than that, so let’s look at some principles…</p>

  <h3 id="object-orientation">Object-orientation</h3>

  <p><i>Object-orientation</i> is a programming paradigm that breaks larger programs
  up into smaller, in(ter)dependent objects that all have their own roles and
  responsibilities. From Wikipedia:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that represents
  the concept of ‘objects’ […] which are usually instances of classes, [and] are
  used to interact with one another to design applications and computer
  programs.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>When applied to CSS, we call it object-oriented CSS, or <i>OOCSS</i>. OOCSS was
  coined and popularised by Nicole Sullivan, whose <cite>Media Object</cite> has
  become the poster child of the methodology.</p>

  <p>OOCSS deals with the separation of UIs into <i>structure</i> and <i>skin</i>:
  breaking UI components into their underlying structural forms, and layering
  their cosmetic forms on separately. This means that we can recycle common and
  recurring design <em>patterns</em> very cheaply without having to necessarily recycle
  their specific implementation details at the same time. OOCSS promotes reuse of
  code, which makes us quicker, as well as keeping the size of our codebase down.</p>

  <p>Structural aspects can be thought of like skeletons; common, recurring frames
  that provide design-free constructs known as <i>objects</i> and
  <i>abstractions</i>. Objects and abstractions are simple design patterns that
  are devoid of any cosmetics; we abstract out the shared structural traits from a
  series of components into a generic object.</p>

  <p>Skin is a layer that we (optionally) add to our structure in order to give
  objects and abstractions a specific look-and-feel. Let’s look at an example:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>/**
  * A simple, design-free button object. Extend this object with a `.btn--*` skin
  * class.
  */
  .btn {
    display: inline-block;
    padding: 1em 2em;
    vertical-align: middle;
  }


  /**
  * Positive buttons’ skin. Extends `.btn`.
  */
  .btn--positive {
    background-color: green;
    color: white;
  }

  /**
  * Negative buttons’ skin. Extends `.btn`.
  */
  .btn--negative {
    background-color: red;
    color: white;
  }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Above, we can see how the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.btn {}</code> class simply provides structural styling to
  an element, and doesn’t concern itself with any cosmetics. We supplement the
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">.btn {}</code> object with a second class, such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">.btn--negative {}</code> in order to
  give that DOM node specific cosmetics:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;button class="btn  btn--negative"&gt;Delete&lt;/button&gt;
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Favour the multiple-class approach over using something like <code class="highlighter-rouge">@extend</code>: using
  multiple classes in your markup—as opposed to wrapping the classes up into one
  using a preprocessor—</p>

  <ul>
    <li>gives you a better paper-trail in your markup, and allows you to see quickly
  and explicitly which classes are acting on a piece of HTML;</li>
    <li>allows for greater composition in that classes are not tightly bound to other
  styles in your CSS.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Whenever you are building a UI component, try and see if you can break it into
  two parts: one for structural styles (paddings, layout, etc.) and another for
  skin (colours, typefaces, etc.).</p>

  <h3 id="the-single-responsibility-principle">The Single Responsibility Principle</h3>

  <p>The <i>single responsibility principle</i> is a paradigm that, very loosely,
  states that all pieces of code (in our case, classes) should focus on doing one
  thing and one thing only. More formally:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>…the single responsibility principle states that every context (class,
  function, variable, etc.) should have a single responsibility, and that
  responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the context.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>What this means for us is that our CSS should be composed of a series of much
  smaller classes that focus on providing very specific and limited functionality.
  This means that we need to decompose UIs into their smallest component pieces
  that each serve a single responsibility; they all do just one job, but can be
  very easily combined and composed to make much more versatile and complex
  constructs. Let’s take some example CSS that does not adhere to the single
  responsibility principle:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.error-message {
    display: block;
    padding: 10px;
    border-top: 1px solid #f00;
    border-bottom: 1px solid #f00;
    background-color: #fee;
    color: #f00;
    font-weight: bold;
  }

  .success-message {
    display: block;
    padding: 10px;
    border-top: 1px solid #0f0;
    border-bottom: 1px solid #0f0;
    background-color: #efe;
    color: #0f0;
    font-weight: bold;
  }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Here we can see that—despite being named after one very specific use-case—these
  classes are handling quite a lot: layout, structure, and cosmetics. We also have
  a <em>lot</em> of repetition. We need to refactor this in order to abstract out some
  shared objects (OOCSS) and bring it more inline with the single responsibility
  principle. We can break these two classes out into four much smaller
  responsibilities:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.box {
    display: block;
    padding: 10px;
  }


  .message {
    border-style: solid;
    border-width: 1px 0;
    font-weight: bold;
  }

  .message--error {
    background-color: #fee;
    color: #f00;
  }

  .message--success {
    background-color: #efe;
    color: #0f0;
  }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Now we have a general abstraction for boxes which can live, and be used,
  completely separately from our message component, and we have a base message
  component that can be extended by a number of smaller responsibility classes.
  The amount of repetition has been greatly reduced, and our ability to extend and
  compose our CSS has been greatly increased. This is a great example of OOCSS and
  the single responsibility principle working in tandem.</p>

  <p>By focussing on single responsibilities, we can give our code much more
  flexibility, and extending components’ functions becomes very simple when
  sticking to the <i>open/closed principle</i>, which we’re going to look at next.</p>

  </ul>

  <h3 id="the-openclosed-principle">The Open/Closed Principle</h3>

  <p>The <i>open/closed principle</i>, in my opinion, is rather poorly named. It is
  poorly named because 50% of the vital information is omitted from its title. The
  open/closed principle states that</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>[s]oftware entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for
  extension, but closed for modification.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>See? The most important words—<i>extension</i> and <i>modification</i>—are
  completely missing from the name, which isn’t very useful at all.</p>

  <p>Once you have trained yourself to remember what the words open and closed
  actually relate to, you’ll find that open/closed principle remarkably simple:
  any additions, new functionality, or features we add to our classes should be
  added via <em>extension</em>—we should not modify these classes directly. This really
  trains us to write bulletproof single responsibilities: because we shouldn’t
  modify objects and abstractions directly, we need to make sure we get them as
  simple as possible the first time. This means that we should never need to
  actually change an abstraction—we’d simply stop using it—but any slight variants
  of it can be made very easily by extending it.</p>

  <p>Let’s take an example:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.box {
    display: block;
    padding: 10px;
  }

  .box--large {
    padding: 20px;
  }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Here we can see that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.box {}</code> object is incredibly simple: we’ve stripped
  it right back into one very small and very focussed responsibility. To modify
  that box, we extend it with another class; <code class="highlighter-rouge">.box--large {}</code>. Here the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.box {}</code>
  class is closed to modification, but open to being extended.</p>

  <p>An incorrect way of achieving the same might look like this:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.box {
    display: block;
    padding: 10px;
  }

  .content .box {
    padding: 20px;
  }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Not only is this overly specific, locationally dependent, and potentially
  displaying poor Selector Intent, we are modifying the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.box {}</code> directly. We
  should rarely—if ever—find an object or abstraction’s class as a key selector in
  a compound selector.</p>

  <p>A selector like <code class="highlighter-rouge">.content .box {}</code> is potentially troublesome because</p>

  <ul>
    <li>it forces all <code class="highlighter-rouge">.box</code> components into that style when placed inside of
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">.content</code>, which means the modification is dictated to developers, whereas
  developers should be allowed to opt into changes explicitly;</li>
    <li>the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.box</code> style is now unpredictable to developers; the single responsibility
  no longer exists because nesting the selector produces a forced caveat.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All modifications, additions, and changes should always be opt-in, not
  mandatory. If you think something might need a slight adjustment to take it away
  from the norm, provide another class which adds this functionality.</p>

  <p>When working in a team environment, be sure to write API-like CSS; always ensure
  that existing classes remain backward compatible (i.e. no changes at their root)
  and provide new hooks to bring in new features. Changing the root object,
  abstraction, or component could have huge knock-on effects for developers making
  use of that code elsewhere, so never modify existing code directly.</p>

  <p>Exceptions may present themselves when it transpires that a root object does
  need a rewrite or refactor, but it is only in these specific cases that you
  should modify code. Remember: <strong>open for extension; closed for modification</strong>.</p>

  <h3 id="dry">DRY</h3>

  <p><i>DRY</i>, which stands for <i>Don’t Repeat Repeat Yourself</i>, is a
  micro-principle used in software development which aims to keep the repetition
  of key information to a minimum. Its formal definition is that</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>[e]very piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative
  representation within a system.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Although a very simple principle—in principle—DRY is often misinterpreted as the
  necessity to never repeat the exact same thing twice at all in a project. This
  is impractical and usually counterproductive, and can lead to forced
  abstractions, over-thought and -engineered code, and unusual dependencies.</p>

  <p>The key isn’t to avoid all repetition, but to normalise and abstract
  <em>meaningful</em> repetition. If two things happen to share the same declarations
  coincidentally, then we needn’t DRY anything out; that repetition is purely
  circumstantial and cannot be shared or abstracted. For example:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.btn {
    display: inline-block;
    padding: 1em 2em;
    font-weight: bold;
  }

  [...]

  .page-title {
    font-size: 3rem;
    line-height: 1.4;
    font-weight: bold;
  }

  [...]

    .user-profile__title {
      font-size: 1.2rem;
      line-height: 1.5;
      font-weight: bold;
    }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>From the above code, we can reasonably deduce that the <code class="highlighter-rouge">font-weight: bold;</code>
  declaration appears three times purely coincidentally. To try and create an
  abstraction, mixin, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">@extend</code> directive to cater for this repetition would
  be overkill, and would tie these three rulesets together based purely on
  circumstance.</p>

  <p>However, imagine we’re using a web-font that requires <code class="highlighter-rouge">font-weight: bold;</code> to be
  declared every time the <code class="highlighter-rouge">font-family</code> is:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>.btn {
    display: inline-block;
    padding: 1em 2em;
    font-family: "My Web Font", sans-serif;
    font-weight: bold;
  }

  [...]

  .page-title {
    font-size: 3rem;
    line-height: 1.4;
    font-family: "My Web Font", sans-serif;
    font-weight: bold;
  }

  [...]

    .user-profile__title {
      font-size: 1.2rem;
      line-height: 1.5;
      font-family: "My Web Font", sans-serif;
      font-weight: bold;
    }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Here we’re repeating a more meaningful snippet of CSS; these two declarations
  have to always be declared together. In this instance, we probably would DRY
  out our CSS.</p>

  <p>I would recommend using a mixin over <code class="highlighter-rouge">@extend</code> here because, even though the two
  declarations are thematically grouped, the rulesets themselves are still 
  separate, unrelated entities: to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">@extend</code> would be to physically group
  these unrelated rulesets together in our CSS, thus making the unrelated related.</p>

  <p>Our mixin:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>@mixin my-web-font() {
    font-family: "My Web Font", sans-serif;
    font-weight: bold;
  }

  .btn {
    display: inline-block;
    padding: 1em 2em;
    @include my-web-font();
  }

  [...]

  .page-title {
    font-size: 3rem;
    line-height: 1.4;
    @include my-web-font();
  }

  [...]

    .user-profile__title {
      font-size: 1.2rem;
      line-height: 1.5;
      @include my-web-font();
    }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>Now the two declarations only exist once, meaning we’re not repeating ourselves.
  If we ever switch out our web-font, or move to a <code class="highlighter-rouge">font-weight: normal;</code>
  version, we only need to make that change in one place.</p>

  <p>In short, only DRY code that is actually, thematically related. Do not try to
  reduce purely coincidental repetition: <strong>duplication is better than the wrong
  abstraction</strong>.</p>

  <h3 id="composition-over-inheritance">Composition over Inheritance</h3>

  <p>Now that we’re used to spotting abstractions and creating single
  responsibilities, we should be in a great position to start composing more
  complex composites from a series of much smaller component parts. Nicole
  Sullivan likens this to using Lego; tiny, single responsibility pieces which can
  be combined in a number of different quantities and permutations to create a
  multitude of very different looking results.</p>

  <p>This idea of building through composition is not a new one, and is often
  referred to as <i>composition over inheritance</i>. This principle suggests that
  larger systems should be composed from much smaller, individual parts, rather
  than inheriting behaviour from a much larger, monolithic object. This should
  keep your code decoupled—nothing inherently relies on anything else.</p>

  <p>Composition is a very valuable principle for an architecture to make use of,
  particularly considering the move toward component-based UIs. It will mean you
  can more easily recycle and reuse functionality, as well rapidly construct
  larger parts of UI from a known set of composable objects. Think back to our
  error message example in the <a href="#the-single-responsibility-principle">Single Responsibility
  Principle</a> section; we created a complete
  UI component by composing a number of much smaller and unrelated objects.</p>

  <h3 id="the-separation-of-concerns">The Separation of Concerns</h3>

  <p>The <i>separation of concerns</i> is a principle which, at first, sounds a lot
  like the single responsibility principle. The separation of concerns states that
  code should be broken up</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern. A
  concern is a set of information that affects the code of a computer program.
  […] A program that embodies SoC well is called a modular program.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Modular is a word we’re probably used to; the idea of breaking UIs and CSS into
  much smaller, composable pieces. The separation of concerns is just a formal
  definition which covers the concepts of modularity and encapsulation in code. In
  CSS this means building individual components, and writing code which only
  focusses itself on one task at a time.</p>

  <p>The term was coined by Edsger W. Dijkstra, who rather elegantly said:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Let me try to explain to you, what to my taste is characteristic for all
  intelligent thinking. It is, that one is willing to study in depth an aspect
  of one’s subject matter in isolation for the sake of its own consistency, all
  the time knowing that one is occupying oneself only with one of the aspects.
  We know that a program must be correct and we can study it from that viewpoint
  only; we also know that it should be efficient and we can study its efficiency
  on another day, so to speak. In another mood we may ask ourselves whether, and
  if so: why, the program is desirable. But nothing is gained—on the
  contrary!—by tackling these various aspects simultaneously. It is what I
  sometimes have called ‘the separation of concerns’, which, even if not
  perfectly possible, is yet the only available technique for effective ordering
  of one’s thoughts, that I know of. This is what I mean by ‘focusing one’s
  attention upon some aspect’: it does not mean ignoring the other aspects, it
  is just doing justice to the fact that from this aspect’s point of view, the
  other is irrelevant. It is being one- and multiple-track minded
  simultaneously.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Beautiful. The idea here is to focus fully on one thing at once; build one thing
  to do its job very well whilst paying as little attention as possible to other
  facets of your code. Once you have addressed and built all these separate
  concerns in isolation—meaning they’re probably very modular, decoupled, and
  encapsulated—you can begin bringing them together into a larger project.</p>

  <p>A great example is layout. If you are using a grid system, all of the code
  pertaining to layout should exist on its own, without including anything else.
  You’ve written code that handles layout, and that’s it:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;div class="layout"&gt;

    &lt;div class="layout__item  two-thirds"&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="layout__item  one-third"&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>You will now need to write new, separate code to handle what lives inside of
  that layout:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;div class="layout"&gt;

    &lt;div class="layout__item  two-thirds"&gt;
      &lt;section class="content"&gt;
        ...
      &lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="layout__item  one-third"&gt;
      &lt;section class="sub-content"&gt;
        ...
      &lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>The separation of concerns allows you to keep code self-sufficient, ignorant,
  and ultimately a lot more maintainable. Code which adheres to the separation of
  concerns can be much more confidently modified, edited, extended, and maintained
  because we know how far its responsibilities reach. We know that modifying
  layout, for example, will only ever modify layout—nothing else.</p>

  <p>The separation of concerns increases reusability and confidence whilst reducing
  dependency.</p>

  <h4 id="misconceptions">Misconceptions</h4>

  <p>There are, I feel, a number of unfortunate misconceptions surrounding the
  separation of concerns when applied to HTML and CSS. They all seem to revolve
  around some format of:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Using classes for CSS in your markup breaks the separation of concerns.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Unfortunately, this is simply not true. The separation of concerns <em>does</em> exist
  in the context of HTML and CSS (and JS), but not in the way a lot of people seem
  to believe.</p>

  <p>The separation of concerns when applied to front-end code is not about
  classes-in-HTML-purely-for-styling-hooks-blurring-the-lines-between-concerns;
  it is about the very fact that we are using different languages for markup and
  styling at all.</p>

  <p>Back before CSS was widely adopted, we’d use <code class="highlighter-rouge">table</code>s to lay content out, and
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">font</code> elements with <code class="highlighter-rouge">color</code> attributes to provide cosmetic styling. The problem
  here is that HTML was being used to create content and also to style it; there
  was no way of having one without the other. This was a complete lack of
  separation of concerns, which was a problem. CSS’ job was to provide a
  completely new syntax to apply this styling, allowing us to separate our
  content and style concerns across two technologies.</p>

  <p>Another common argument is that <q>putting classes in your HTML puts style
  information in your markup</q>.</p>

  <p>So, in a bid to circumvent this, people adopt selectors that might look a little
  like this:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>body &gt; header:first-of-type &gt; nav &gt; ul &gt; li &gt; a {
  }
  </code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>This CSS—presumably to style our site’s main nav—has the usual problems of
  location dependency, poor Selector Intent, and high specificity, but it also
  manages to do <em>exactly what developers are trying to avoid</em>, only in the
  opposite direction: <strong>it puts DOM information in your CSS</strong>. Aggressive attempts
  to avoid putting any style hints or hooks in markup only lead to overloading
  stylesheets with DOM information.</p>

  <p>In short: having classes in your markup does not violate the separation of
  concerns. Classes merely act as an API to link two separate concerns together.
  The simplest way to separate concerns is to write well formed HTML and well
  formed CSS, and link to two together with sensible, judicious use of classes.</p>
